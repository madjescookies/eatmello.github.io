  <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
  <p class="text-emphasis"> Our mission is to bring joy, awaken curiosity, and take <i>all of you</i> on a flavorful journey, one sweet bite at a time!</p>
  <p>
    What better way to do that than with delicious cookies that are guaranteed to titillate your tastebuds? Because, let's be honest, you've never felt sad while eating a tasty treat, and if you have, it was probably one of those fake keto things. No shade to the keto community, we love butter and coconut oil too.
  </p>
  <p>
      We want to add more exciting choices to your grocery store’s cookie aisle and honor those relaxing moments where all you can handle is your favorite show/book and a delicious cookie. Sometimes you may want to share us with friends – we’re okay with that too, we want you to be the talk of the party ;)
  </p>
  <p>
    Gone are the days of shamefully eating an entire box of cookies in the dark because you’ve been too strict on yourself. We’re here to remind you that it’s okay to treat yourself! Have a bit of happiness. You deserve it!

    <br>She enjoys making up recipes and blending traditional american flavors with those of the various cultures she has been exposed to throughout her childhood.
